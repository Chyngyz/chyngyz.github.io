This is my first blog post. The primary reason of this blog is to store useful information taken during working and learning processes. Here I'd like to share my ideas, experiences and anything that is interesting. I love modern technology, web and mobile app development, minimalistic web design and enthusiastic about events related to these. So you can expect from me posts about AngularJS, MEAN Stack, web design, mobile application development, tools that I use and various events I attended. I am very excited about my blog, so I will try to blog as often as possible.
