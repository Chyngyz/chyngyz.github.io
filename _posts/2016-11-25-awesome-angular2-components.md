This is a post intro to the [Awesome Angular 2 components catalog](https://github.com/Chyngyz/awesome-angular2-components) that was inspired from the ReactJS Community [one](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components).
Though there is not as many libs and components compared to ReactJS one, I believe in some days it will be of great use, to quickly find the appropriate tools and libs.

All components and libs are Angular 2 final compatible.

To add a component/library, open an issue or create a pull request with an edited [ReadME](https://github.com/Chyngyz/awesome-angular2-components). It will be added to the catalog once it is checked.
