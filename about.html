<p>My name is Chyngyz Arystan uulu, and I am front-end developer. I've always been curious about the web and design, how both can interact with each other, thus creating huge effect on our surrounding and our daily life. And I love to be part of this process, converting beautiful art into interactive online friend, passing through challenges on the way. Being an observant person, I tend to make every single detail as good as possible, as I believe that "Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right.".</p>

<p>I have degree in Translation(English, Turkish, Russian), and 2 years of studies at EMU University, CS department. I found courage not to finish EMU, and dive straight into the process of learn-by-building. So technically I am self-learned developer.  </p>
