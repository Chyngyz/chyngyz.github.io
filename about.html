<p>My name is Chyngyz Arystan uulu, and I am self-learned frontend developer. I've always been curious about the web and design, how both can interact with each other. And I love to be part of this process, converting beautiful design into interactive website, passing through challenges on the way. Being an observant person, I tend to make every single detail as good as possible, as I believe that "Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right.".</p>
