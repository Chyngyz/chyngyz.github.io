<p>Hi, I'm Chyngyz, frontend developer from Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. I've always been curious about the web and design, how both can interact with each other. And I love to be part of this process, converting beautiful design into interactive website, passing through challenges on the way. Being an observant person, I tend to make every single detail as good as possible, as I believe that "Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right.".</p>



<strong>I love:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>AngularJS, SASS, Gulp, Webpack</li>
	<li>Ionic Framework and new NativeScript 2</li>
	<li>NodeJs and Python</li>
	<li>Git</li>
</ul>
